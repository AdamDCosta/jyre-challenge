# Jyre Challenge

## Challenge: Exploring the 9 Leader Types

We'd like you to build a simple UI in Javascript or Typescript (using a front-end framework of your choice) that displays information on Jyre's 9 Leader types. You'll need to retrieve the information to be displayed from Prismic, a headless CMS which we use to host content and make our platform extensible.

 

### Here are the requirements:

The purpose of this initial UI is to present information for a user who is interested in finding out more about the different Jyre Leader types.

Your UI should make use of Prismic at runtime, so that changes to the content are reflected on refresh.

Your UI should use all of the information available in Prismic, including colours, images, and text.

Your UI should work well on both mobile and desktop.

You should focus on creating a UI that is clean and visually appealing to you - don't feel the need to copy the existing Jyre visual style.

You're welcome to include automated tests in your submission if you find it helps you to complete the challenge, but this isn't required/expected due to the limited scope.

You should clean (no node_modules directories please), and share your submission (via email, link, Github, etc.), including all of the files required to build and run the app.
